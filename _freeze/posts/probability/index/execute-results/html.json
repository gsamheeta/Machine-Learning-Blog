Random variables represent uncertain quantities. They come in two types: discrete (distinct values) and continuous (any value within a range). Probability distributions describe how random variables behave, either assigning probabilities to specific values (PMF for discrete) or intervals (PDF for continuous). These concepts are crucial in fields like statistics and machine learning for modeling and decision-making in uncertain scenarios.'\n---\n\n![](randomvariables.png)\n\n**Contents:**\n\n-   Introduction to Probability Theory and Random Variables.\n\n-   Introduction to Random Variables.\n\n-   Introduction to Probability .\n\n-   Discrete Probability Distribution.\n\n-   Continuous Probability Distribution.\n\n-   Example of discrete probability distribution.\n\n-   Example of contunious probability distribution.\n\n\n## Probability Theory and Random Variables\n\nProbability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty and randomness. It provides a framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty, making predictions in uncertain situations, and analyzing random phenomena. One of the fundamental concepts in probability theory is that of a random variable.\n\n\n## Random Variable\n\nA random variable is a mathematical concept used to represent uncertain or random quantities in a probabilistic model. It assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome of a random experiment. Random variables can be classified into two main types:\n\n- Discrete Random Variables: Discrete random variables take on a countable set of distinct values. These values can often be enumerated. Common examples include the number of heads obtained when flipping a coin multiple times or the number of customers arriving at a store in a given hour.\n\n- Continuous Random Variables: Continuous random variables can take on any value within a certain range, often an interval of real numbers. These values are typically associated with measurements and can have an infinite number of possible outcomes. Examples include the height of individuals in a population or the time it takes for a computer to complete a task.\n\nRandom variables are denoted by letters, typically uppercase, such as X, Y, or Z. The possible values that a random variable can take on are called its \"range\" or \"sample space.\" For discrete random variables, the range is a set of distinct values, while for continuous random variables, the range is a continuous interval.\n\n## Probability:\n\nProbability is a fundamental concept in mathematics, statistics, and everyday life. It quantifies the likelihood or chance of an event or outcome occurring in uncertain or random situations. In essence, probability helps us understand and measure uncertainty. Here are some key aspects of probability:\n\n![](probability1.png)\n\n- Event and Outcome: In probability, an \"event\" is a specific result or occurrence of interest, while an \"outcome\" is a particular result of a random experiment or process. Events can range from simple, like the outcome of a coin flip (heads or tails), to complex, like the probability of a stock market crash.\n\n- Sample Space: The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For example, when rolling a six-sided die, the sample space consists of the numbers 1 through 6.\n\n- Probability as a Number: Probabilities are expressed as numbers between 0 and 1, where 0 represents an impossible event, and 1 represents a certain event. A probability of 0.5 (or 50%) indicates a 50-50 chance of an event occurring.\n\n- Events and Probability: The probability of an event is typically denoted as P(E), where E is the event. The probability of an event can be calculated using various methods, depending on the type of probability distribution and the nature of the problem.\n\nNow, let's delve into the two specific probability distributions\n\n##  Discrete Probability Distribution:\nA discrete probability distribution deals with random variables that can take on a finite or countable number of distinct values. Each of these values has an associated probability of occurrence. Discrete probability distributions are used in situations where outcomes are countable and distinct.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n- Bernoulli Distribution: Models binary outcomes like success/failure, heads/tails. It has a single parameter, p, which represents the probability of success.\n- Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes (k) in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (n) with the same probability of success (p).\n- Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\n## Continuous Probability Distribution:\n\nA continuous probability distribution deals with random variables that can take on an infinite number of values within a given interval. These distributions are used when outcomes can take any value within a range, often due to measurement precision or inherent continuity.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n- Normal Distribution (Gaussian): Characterized by a symmetric bell-shaped curve with parameters μ (mean) and σ (standard deviation). Widely used in various fields to model natural phenomena.\n- Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process, such as arrival times at a service center.\n- Uniform Distribution: Assigns equal probability density to all values within a specified interval.\n\n\nIn both types of distributions, the probabilities are defined in different ways. Discrete distributions use probability mass functions (PMFs) to describe the likelihood of discrete outcomes, while continuous distributions use probability density functions (PDFs) to describe the likelihood of outcomes within a continuous range. Understanding these probability distributions and their associated mathematical functions is crucial in statistics, data analysis, and making informed decisions in situations involving uncertainty and randomness.\n\n\n## Example for Bernoulli Distribution\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import bernoulli\n\n# Probability of success\np = 0.5\n\n# Possible outcomes\noutcomes = [0, 1]\n\n# PMF values\npmf_values = [bernoulli.pmf(x, p) for x in outcomes]\n\n# Plotting\nplt.bar(outcomes, pmf_values)\nplt.xticks(outcomes, ['Failure', 'Success'])\nplt.ylabel('Probability')\nplt.title('Bernoulli Distribution PMF (p = 0.5)')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=589 height=431}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Example forBinomial Distribution\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import binom\n\n# Parameters\nn = 10\np = 0.5\n\n# Possible number of successes\nk_values = range(n+1)\n\n# PMF values\npmf_values = [binom.pmf(k, n, p) for k in k_values]\n\n# Plotting\nplt.bar(k_values, pmf_values)\nplt.xlabel('Number of successes')\nplt.ylabel('Probability')\nplt.title('Binomial Distribution PMF (n=10, p=0.5)')\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=597 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Example for Poisson Distribution\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import binom\n\n# Parameters\nn = 10\np = 0.5\n\n# Possible number of successes\nk_values = range(n+1)\n\n# PMF values\npmf_values = [binom.pmf(k, n, p) for k in k_values]\n\n# Plotting\nplt.bar(k_values, pmf_values)\nplt.xlabel('Number of successes')\nplt.ylabel('Probability')\nplt.title('Binomial Distribution PMF (n=10, p=0.5)')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=597 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Normal Distribution\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\n# Parameters for the Normal distribution\nmu = 0  # mean\nsigma = 1  # standard deviation\n\n# Generate values within a range\nx = np.linspace(mu - 3*sigma, mu + 3*sigma, 1000)\n\n# Calculate the PDF\npdf = norm.pdf(x, mu, sigma)\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))\nplt.plot(x, pdf, label=f'Normal Distribution (μ={mu}, σ={sigma})')\nplt.title('Normal Distribution PDF')\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.ylabel('Density')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.png){width=672 height=376}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exponential Distribution\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import expon\n\n# Rate parameter for the exponential distribution\nlambda_exp = 1\n\n# Generate values for the x-axis\nx_exp = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)\n\n# Calculate the PDF\npdf_exp = expon.pdf(x_exp, scale=1/lambda_exp)\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))\nplt.plot(x_exp, pdf_exp, label=f'Exponential Distribution (λ={lambda_exp})')\nplt.title('Exponential Distribution PDF')\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.ylabel('Density')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){width=663 height=376}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Uniform Distribution\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom scipy.stats import uniform\n\n# Parameters for the uniform distribution\na, b = 0, 5\n\n# Generate values within the range\nx_uniform = np.linspace(a, b, 1000)\n\n# Calculate the PDF\npdf_uniform = uniform.pdf(x_uniform, loc=a, scale=b-a)\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))\nplt.plot(x_uniform, pdf_uniform, label=f'Uniform Distribution (a={a}, b={b})')\nplt.title('Uniform Distribution PDF')\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.ylabel('Density')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-7-output-1.png){width=689 height=376}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
